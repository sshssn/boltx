# Gravatar Setup Guide

Your app now supports Gravatar avatars! This means users can have consistent profile pictures across the web.

## What is Gravatar?

Gravatar (Globally Recognized Avatar) is a service that provides user avatars based on email addresses. When you sign up for Gravatar and upload a profile picture, it automatically appears on any website that supports Gravatar.

## How to Set Up Your Gravatar

### 1. Visit Gravatar.com
Go to [https://gravatar.com](https://gravatar.com) and click "Create Your Own Gravatar"

### 2. Create an Account
- Sign up with your email address
- Verify your email address

### 3. Upload Your Profile Picture
- Click "Add a new image"
- Upload a photo of yourself (or any image you want to use)
- Crop and adjust the image as needed
- Give it a rating (G, PG, R, or X)

### 4. Link to Your Email
- Select the email address you use for this app
- Choose the image you just uploaded
- Save your changes

## Supported Email Providers

Gravatar works with **any email provider**, including:
- **Google (Gmail)**: `yourname@gmail.com`
- **Yahoo**: `yourname@yahoo.com` or `yourname@ymail.com`
- **GitHub**: `yourname@users.noreply.github.com`
- **Microsoft (Outlook/Hotmail)**: `yourname@outlook.com`

## How It Works in This App

1. **Automatic Detection**: When you sign in, the app automatically checks if you have a Gravatar for your email address

3. **Consistent Experience**: Your avatar will appear in:
   - Sidebar user navigation
   - Account dashboard
   - Chat interface
   - Any other place where your profile is shown

## Benefits

- **Privacy Control**: You control what image is associated with your email

## Troubleshooting

**My avatar isn't showing up:**
- Make sure you've uploaded an image to Gravatar.com
- Verify the email address is correctly linked to your Gravatar
- Wait a few minutes for changes to propagate

**I want to use a different image:**
- Go to Gravatar.com and upload a new image
- Link it to your email address
- Changes will appear within a few minutes

**I don't want to use Gravatar:**

## Privacy Note

Gravatar only shares your profile picture, not your email address. The email is hashed before being sent to Gravatar's servers.
